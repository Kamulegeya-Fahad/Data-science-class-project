# Data-science-class-project

This is a simple class project where i trained different neural networks to classify chest X-ray images.

I provide a step by step explanation through the process and also provide the code so that one can try experimenting with the code.

I conclude with the analysis of the performance of each architecture on my dataset

contact me for more detailed explanation
